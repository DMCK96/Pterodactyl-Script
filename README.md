# Supported Operating System
RHEL, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux and Alma Linux are recommended over Ubuntu and Debian due to the new Appstream system introduced in RHEL 8. With modular repos, package management with dnf became so much easier and cleaner compared to apt. <br />

Fedora is not recommended due to its short life cycle. However, if you live on the edge and can handle frequent major updates on your own, then it is fine.
