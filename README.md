# Pterodactyl v1.0 Release Candidate
Pterodactyl v1.0 will NOT be supported until it is ready for production. <br />
With that being said, you can still try out the v1.0 script version using: <br />
<br />
`bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tommytran732/Pterodactyl-Script/pterodactyl-1.0/install.sh)`
<br />
<br>
A migration script from v0.7 to v1.0 will be available at a later date.
